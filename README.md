Psychic Game Homework

The Psychic Game created prompts users to guess a random letter that the computer has chosen. The user has 10 opportunities per round to guess the correct letter. If the correct letter is selected before running out of guesses the user has a point added to their wins. If the correct letter is not selected after 10 attempts then a point is added to the user's losses. 

The game begins when the user selects a letter on the keyboard. Everytime a key is pushed the number of remaining guesses decreases and the selected letter is logged on the screen. An alert will appear every time a user wins or loses and displays the letter the computer randomly chose.
